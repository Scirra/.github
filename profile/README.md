# Scirra on GitHub

Hi! We're Scirra Ltd, and we make [Construct](https://www.construct.net), powerful browser-based tools for game development and animation.

Construct is primarily a closed-source commercial tool. However we use GitHub repositories for tracking issues, such as the [Construct bugs](https://github.com/Scirra/Construct-bugs) repository, as GitHub's issues feature works very well for the purpose. We also have some open-source components available here in the repositories shown below. They include the code for our [Addon SDK](https://github.com/Scirra/Construct-Addon-SDK), and a couple of plugins like our [Steamworks](https://github.com/Scirra/Construct-Plugin-Steamworks) and [Epic Games](https://github.com/Scirra/Construct-Plugin-EpicGames) integration.

If you have any questions about Construct or need any help, you'd be best off [heading to our main website](https://www.construct.net/) where we have forums, FAQs, contact information, comprehensive documentation, and more.
